                <p>I have spent five years in the visual merchandising business, working as a finisher and finishing manager for companies like Geoff Howell Studio inc. and Guild, throughout that time I developed a creative sense and a great eye for color, texture, and improvisation. What I mainly did was painting –most of the time with a spray gun– from walls, to shapes and figures, like full-size two-dimensional cows, or columns made out of foam. During that time I started my studies in mechanical engineering at New York City College of Technology, and it was there where I had my first encounter to programming through an introductory class that I took outside of my curriculum.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have always loved to take things apart and put things together, four years ago I finally took courage to put together my first dream bicycle, and even though it has taken time to perfect certain aspects of it, like the gear ratio. It is always my best ride, which I also use in competitions.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As I talked with an acquaintance about my likes, he told me that programming can be the best thing for me to pursue for living. Something that will challenge me every time, that is as much an art as it could be science, that no matter how much I have learned, it will always feel like being at the start. That acquaintance recommended me to study at General Assembly to fast-track my learning, and I did, and even though I successfully learned two languages, five frameworks,  manipulate them and enjoy them, I know I will always feel like being on square one, and I love it!</p>

                <p>~ A keen eye for detail and creative thinking, I love a good challenge and enjoy learning new skills, languages, and frameworks to improve myself every day. There are three main places you could find me: working on my computer, riding my bicycle, or supporting a good cause. ~</p>
